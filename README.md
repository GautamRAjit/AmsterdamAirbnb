# Amsterdam Airbnb

## Overview

This project aims to explore the factors that drive the prices of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam. By understanding the possible relationships between these factors and the price, the project aims to use these insights to benefit and encourage prospective Airbnb hosts to create new listings in neighbourhoods that are high in demand.

## Objectives

- Do all hosts who have listings in the city of Amsterdam are prompt with responses to prospective customers?
- Does geography of the city have anything to do with the number of listings, i.e., are listings concentrated in downtown Amsterdam or are the outskirts of the city just as promising?
- Is there any underlying linear relationship between the price of a listing and the number of bedrooms in the listing? 
- Is there any segmentation possible based on the pricing of the listing? How many people can each segment accomodate?
- What are the limitations of this dataset? What can be done to estimate a more accurate prediction of pricing?
- How does the pricing structure relate to the availability of the listings for long-term stays, like a month?
